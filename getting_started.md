# Getting Started

**To-do:**
* Install and experiment with ndn-tools
* Understand our testbed more (like how the interfaces work as far as the software)
* Understand the 4 things that come up on ifconfig (eth0/eth1.. stuff)
* Test if node1 and node3 (not directly linked) will be connected.


**Instructions:**
1. Create a POWDER profile - the provided profile contained in powder_test.py provides a good starting point. Any number of nodes can be used, just be sure they are linked together in the geni-lab script. (note that only two can be linked per Link or Interface object)

1. Install NFD software on nodes - detailed instructions can be found here: http://named-data.net/doc/NFD/current/INSTALL.html (note that using the PPA repository is much simpler than building from source)

1. Using the "ifconfig" config command to identify IP addresses of the various VMs. <insert screen shot>
