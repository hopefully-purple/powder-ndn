TODO:::

1) Install and experiment with ndn-tools
2) Understand our testbed more (like how the interfaces work as far as the software)
3) Understand the 4 things that come up on ifconfig (eth0/eth1.. stuff)
4) Test if node1 and node3 (not directly linked) will be connected.


THINGS WE"VE LEARNED:
1) Creating a Profile
  Code: powder_test.py
  Create a profile with any number of nodes (we used 4) and link them together. We found that you can only link nodes one at a time and not
  all at once.
  
2) Install NFD software on Nodes
  Use the PPA method http://named-data.net/doc/NFD/current/INSTALL.html to install and run the software. 
    a) using the command "sudo ifconfig" (with or without sudo) you can figure out the IP address of the VM. <insert screen shot>
